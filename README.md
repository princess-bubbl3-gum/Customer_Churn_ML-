# Customer Churn Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict customer churn using historical customer data. Churn prediction helps businesses identify customers who are likely to stop using their service, enabling proactive retention strategies.

The project covers:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Model building and selection (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
- Model evaluation and performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, ROC-AUC)
- Saving the trained model for future predictions

## Folder Structure
- `data/` — Contains raw and processed datasets
- `notebooks/` — Jupyter notebooks for EDA, modeling, and evaluation
- `models/` — Trained machine learning models saved as pickle files
- `outputs/` — Visualizations and logs
- `requirements.txt` — List of Python dependencies

## Usage
1. Clone the repo:
  git clone https://github.com/princess-bubbl3-gum/Customer_Churn_ML.git
2. Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run notebook

## Dependencies
  - Python 3.x
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - scikit-learn
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
